The enhancement replaces the current download templates with two new standardized templates: \"备案产品自主注册信息登记表\" (Filing Product Registration Form) and \"农险产品信息登记表\" (Agricultural Insurance Product Registration Form). The system will provide users with template selection options and updated validation rules to ensure data integrity and compliance with the new template formats.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis feature directly supports the product vision by:\r\n- **Improving Data Quality**: Enhanced template validation ensures accurate product information capture\r\n- **Supporting Regulatory Compliance**: New templates align with current regulatory requirements for insurance product filing\r\n- **Enhancing User Experience**: Clear template selection and improved validation feedback\r\n- **Maintaining System Reliability**: Robust validation prevents data corruption and ensures system stability\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Template Download Enhancement\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a business user importing products, I want to download the appropriate product registration template, so that I can fill out the correct form for my product type and ensure compliance with current standards.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN user clicks \"下载导入模版\" (Download Import Template) THEN system SHALL display template selection options\r\n2. WHEN user selects template type THEN system SHALL provide two template options:\r\n   - \"备案产品自主注册信息登记表\" (Filing Product Registration Form)\r\n   - \"农险产品信息登记表\" (Agricultural Insurance Product Registration Form)\r\n3. WHEN user clicks template download link THEN system SHALL download the corresponding Excel file\r\n4. WHEN templates are displayed THEN system SHALL show clear descriptions for each template type\r\n5. WHEN user accesses download feature THEN system SHALL replace old templates with new standardized versions\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Template Selection Interface\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a business user, I want to clearly identify which template to use for my product type, so that I can select the most appropriate registration form.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN download template dialog opens THEN system SHALL display template selection interface\r\n2. WHEN template options are shown THEN system SHALL provide:\r\n   - Template name\r\n   - Template description\r\n   - Applicable product types\r\n   - File format information\r\n3. WHEN user hovers over template option THEN system SHALL show additional details\r\n4. WHEN user makes selection THEN system SHALL highlight selected template\r\n5. WHEN selection is confirmed THEN system SHALL initiate template download\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Enhanced Import Validation\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a business user uploading a completed template, I want the system to validate my data against the new template format, so that I can ensure all required information is correctly provided and formatted.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN user uploads Excel file THEN system SHALL detect template type automatically\r\n2. WHEN template type is identified THEN system SHALL apply appropriate validation rules\r\n3. WHEN validation runs THEN system SHALL check:\r\n   - Required field completeness\r\n   - Data format compliance\r\n   - Field value constraints\r\n   - Cross-field validation rules\r\n4. WHEN validation fails THEN system SHALL display specific error messages with field references\r\n5. WHEN validation passes THEN system SHALL proceed with data extraction and form population\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Data Mapping and Extraction\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a business user, I want the system to automatically extract information from my uploaded template and populate the product form, so that I don't need to manually re-enter data.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN valid template is uploaded THEN system SHALL extract data fields automatically\r\n2. WHEN data extraction occurs THEN system SHALL map fields to corresponding form elements:\r\n   - 备案产品模板: 开发类型, 产品性质, 年度, 产品名称, 修订类型, 原产品名称和备案编号, 报送类型, 主附险类型, 主险情况, 产品类别, 经营范围, 示范条款名称, 经营区域1, 经营区域2, 销售推广名称\r\n   - 农险产品模板: 报送类型, 产品性质, 年度, 产品名称, 修订类型, 原产品名称和编号, 开发方式, 主附险, 主险情况, 产品类别, 经营区域\r\n3. WHEN form fields are populated THEN system SHALL maintain field validation states\r\n4. WHEN extraction encounters errors THEN system SHALL log specific field issues\r\n5. WHEN manual override is needed THEN system SHALL allow user to modify auto-populated values\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: Template-Specific Field Validation\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a business user, I want field-level validation specific to each template type, so that I can ensure data meets the requirements for my chosen product registration method.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN 备案产品模板 is used THEN system SHALL enforce:\r\n   - 开发类型 as required field\r\n   - 产品名称 as required field\r\n   - 修订类型 as required field\r\n   - 示范条款名称 as required field\r\n2. WHEN 农险产品模板 is used THEN system SHALL enforce:\r\n   - 报送类型 as required field\r\n   - 产品名称 as required field\r\n   - 修订类型 as required field\r\n3. WHEN field validation runs THEN system SHALL check data type compatibility\r\n4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN system SHALL display field-specific error messages\r\n5. WHEN all validations pass THEN system SHALL enable form submission\r\n\r\n### Requirement 6: Database Storage Enhancement\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want product data from new templates to be correctly stored in the database, so that all product information is properly persisted and retrievable.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN validated data is submitted THEN system SHALL store data in appropriate database tables\r\n2. WHEN template-specific fields are processed THEN system SHALL map to correct database columns\r\n3. WHEN data storage occurs THEN system SHALL maintain referential integrity\r\n4. WHEN storage operation completes THEN system SHALL return success confirmation\r\n5. WHEN storage fails THEN system SHALL provide detailed error information and rollback changes\r\n\r\n### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure existing product data remains accessible, so that historical records are not affected by the template update.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN new templates are deployed THEN system SHALL maintain access to existing product records\r\n2. WHEN old template data is accessed THEN system SHALL display correctly in current interface\r\n3. WHEN data migration is needed THEN system SHALL provide migration utilities\r\n4. WHEN mixed template types exist THEN system SHALL handle both formats appropriately\r\n5. WHEN queries are executed THEN system SHALL return consistent results across template versions\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Template handling, validation, and data extraction should be separate modules\r\n- **Modular Design**: Template processors should be pluggable to support future template additions\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Template validation should not depend on UI components\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between template processing and form handling\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Template download should complete within 3 seconds\r\n- File upload and validation should process within 10 seconds for files up to 10MB\r\n- Data extraction should complete within 5 seconds for standard templates\r\n- Form population should be instantaneous after successful extraction\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Uploaded files must be validated for file type and size before processing\r\n- Template files should be scanned for malicious content\r\n- User sessions must be maintained during file upload operations\r\n- File access should be logged for audit purposes\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- System should handle corrupted or invalid Excel files gracefully\r\n- Template processing should include error recovery mechanisms\r\n- Failed uploads should not affect existing product data\r\n- System should maintain consistent state during template processing operations\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Template selection interface should be intuitive and self-explanatory\r\n- Error messages should be clear and actionable\r\n- Template download should work across different browsers and devices\r\n- Field validation feedback should be immediate and contextual",
