This is a placeholder Excel template file for the product import functionality.
In a real implementation, this would be a valid Excel template with predefined structure
for importing product data into the system.

The template would typically include:
- Product name
- Product type
- Product category
- Required fields for validation
- Data format specifications

For MVP purposes, this placeholder file demonstrates the download functionality.
